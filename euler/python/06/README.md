*Number 6:
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.*

Sum of the first n integers:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n} k=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

Sum of the square of the first n integers:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n k^2=\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$

Difference of the square of the sum of the first n integers and the sum of
the squares of the first n integers:

$${\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)}^2-\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$

Simplified:

$$\frac{3n^4+2n^3-3n^2-2n}{12}$$
